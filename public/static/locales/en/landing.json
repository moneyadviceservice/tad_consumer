Examples of conditions might be cancer, stroke or serious heart condition, respiratory conditions or conditions that have been diagnosed as terminal.<p >However, different firms have different views on what conditions are ‘high risk’ and its worth trying more than one.</p></article>"

          "answer": "<article class='accordion'><p>Almost certainly they will be able to get travel insurance cheaper through a mainstream provider.  However, there are two possible problems with that.</p><p>Firstly, if you have to cancel your trip because of your medical condition, the cost of your trip will be fully covered by the insurance – but theirs may not be.  If your travelling companion(s) take out separate insurance, they should read the cancellation terms very carefully.</p><p>Secondly, if you need medical attention while you are away and need to be relocated – or even brought home – any additional costs for you will be covered by the insurance.  However, this won’t be the case for anyone travelling with you. Again, read the terms and conditions very carefully.</p></article>"

          "answer": "<article class='accordion'><p>That’s fine.  Just answer the questions using the information for the person travelling.  Firms on the Directory are likely to ask you if you have permission to share information on the other person’s behalf and your relationship to them (for example if you are a spouse or parent or carer).   If it’s possible for the person you are acting on behalf of to be with you when you are telephoning specialist firms, that will help to speed things up.</p></article>"

          "question": "Why is it more expensive to get travel insurance to cover some medical conditions?",
          "answer": "<article class='accordion'><p>There are a number of factors that insurers take into account when working out how much you have to pay.  For example, the cost of medical treatment can be more in some countries than in others (Spain, United States and Canada are among the more expensive countries).   Insurers will also consider the type and severity of your medical condition(s) and how long you intend to be away.  Your age will also play a part.</p><p>The only way to check that you are getting a good deal is to get quotations from more than one firm.  Unfortunately, it can be quite lengthy going through the full underwriting process but don’t be put off by this.  Most firms offer ‘quick quotes’ where you can talk to someone and provide high-level information regarding your condition and get an idea of cost.</article></p>"

        {
          "question": "What is medical screening?",
          "answer": "<article class='accordion'><p>Most firms that provide travel insurance for people with serious medical conditions use a medical screening company. You will be asked questions about your condition(s) and the medication you are taking.  The answers you give will decide whether you will be offered travel insurance and the price you will be asked to pay. Travel insurance providers use different medical screeners and you may get a different decision or price depending on which medical screener considers your application.  So, if you are asking for quotes from more than one travel insurance provider, choose firms that link to different medical screeners. We've given the name of the medical screening company used by each firm to make this easier for you.</article></p>"
