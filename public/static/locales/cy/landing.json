          "answer": "<article class='accordion'><p>There are a number of different factors that insurers take into account when working out how much you have to pay.  For example, the cost of medical treatment can be more in some countries than in others (Spain, United States and Canada are among the more expensive countries).   Insurers will also consider the type and severity of your medical condition(s) and how long you intend to be away.  Your age will also play a part.</p><p>The only way to check that you are getting a good deal is to get quotations from more than one firm.  Unfortunately, it can be quite lengthy going through the full underwriting process but don’t be put off by this.  Most firms offer ‘quick quotes’ where you can talk to someone and provide high level information regarding your condition and get an idea of cost.</p></article>"

          "question": "What is medical screening?",
          "answer": "<article class='accordion'><p>Most firms that provide travel insurance for people with serious medical conditions use a medical screening company. You will be asked questions about your condition(s) and the medication you are taking.  The answers you give will decide whether you will be offered travel insurance and the price you will be asked to pay. Travel insurance providers use different medical screeners and you may get a different decision or price depending on which medical screener considers your application.  So, if you are asking for quotes from more than one travel insurance provider, choose firms that link to different medical screeners. We've given the name of the medical screening company used by each firm to make this easier for you.</p></article>"
